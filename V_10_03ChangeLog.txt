Changes since version 9.4:

- improved error handling of invalid folder name in command-line arguments

- improved efficiency of retrieving metadata (date-taken, comment) from image files

- enabled global (across all selected folders) sort by date; uses date-taken metadata if available, otherwise date file last modified. Formerly only sorted files to display by filename within each folder, or randomly across all folders.

- removed code that called Windows API to alter screen resolution and refresh frequency; no longer needed (by me, anyway)

- internal improvements such as more graceful program termination
